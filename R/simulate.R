## Simulation truth, designs and data generation (Phase 5).
##
## The generating model is the same `nec4param` the arms fit, on the raw SGR
## scale, with a genuinely negative lower asymptote. Everything is parameterised
## in the quantities the study argues about -- `R` (the control fold-change) and
## `Delta` (the discarded effect fraction) -- rather than in raw curve
## coefficients, so that a simulation cell and a real dataset can be compared
## directly.

#' The nec4param mean function, matching bayesnec's exactly
#'
#' `beta` is on the log scale: bayesnec writes `exp(beta)` inside the
#' exponential, so a `beta` of 0 is a decay rate of 1 per concentration unit.
nec4param_curve <- function(x, top, bot, beta, nec) {
  bot + (top - bot) * exp(-exp(beta) * (x - nec) * (x >= nec))
}

#' Build a truth from the study's own parameters
#'
#' @param R Control fold-change over the test. Sets `mu_0 = log(R)/t`, so `R`
#'   and `Delta` vary independently -- which the four real datasets cannot do,
#'   and which is the reason the simulation exists.
#' @param delta Discarded effect fraction `|bot|/mu_0`.
#' @param t Test duration in days.
#' @param nec True no-effect concentration.
#' @param beta Log decay rate.
## Defaults are the arm-A posterior means on c_proliferum, not hand-picked
## values: nec = 1.30, beta = -3.573 (a decay rate of 0.028 per ug/L),
## top = 0.130, delta = 7.97. Reproducing them recovers that dataset's
## endpoints -- ErC50 3.34 against the fitted 3.36, zero crossing 5.51 against
## 5.65.
##
## Getting this wrong is not a detail. An earlier pilot used nec = 5 with
## beta = log(0.4), which put the whole transition from control to zero growth
## inside 0.6 concentration units -- a near-step function no design can resolve
## and on which every arm would fail identically. Calibrating the SHAPE, not
## just the asymptotes, is what makes the arms distinguishable at all.

#' Residual scale as a function of concentration
#'
#' Homoscedastic, or rising linearly with the fraction of the curve's range
#' already lost. `sigma_ratio` is the residual SD at the lower asymptote divided
#' by the residual SD at the control; it is calibrated from the real data by
#' `calibrate_sigma()` rather than assumed.
#'
#' Note that `bnec()` has no route to a distributional sigma (bayesnec issue
#' #191), so the heteroscedastic cells are *generated* heteroscedastic and
#' *fitted* homoscedastic. That is the realistic case, and it is described in
#' the results as misspecification rather than as a fitting option.
#' @param sigma_mode How the control residual SD is set.
#'   `"cv"` holds the *coefficient of variation* of the growth rate fixed, so
#'   `sigma_0 = cv_control * top`. `"absolute"` holds `sigma_0` itself fixed at
#'   `sigma_0_abs`, independent of the growth rate.
#' @param sigma_0_abs Control residual SD for `sigma_mode = "absolute"`. Anchor
#'   it with `sigma_0_at()` so that the reference cell is unchanged.
##
## Why the mode matters, and why "absolute" is the physically right default for
## any cell that varies R.
##
## Under "cv" the generating model is EXACTLY equivariant under rescaling the
## growth rate. top, bot and sigma are all proportional to mu_0 = log(R)/t,
## while nec, beta and the design do not involve R at all, so changing R
## multiplies every simulated response by a constant and leaves the x-axis
## untouched. Since ErCx, NSEC and the zero crossing are all x-axis quantities,
## and since flooring (max(y,0)), censoring (y <= 0) and a bot fixed at 0 are
## all scale-equivariant too, EVERY arm returns the same answer at every R.
## Verified numerically: with a common seed, y(R=73) = 5.1512 * y(R=2.3) to
## 3e-16, with identical rows floored and identical f_neg.
##
## So R is not an axis under "cv" -- which is a result in itself, and explains
## why Phase 3's R-ordering prediction failed on the real data. It was not
## underpowered at n = 4; it was structurally impossible.
##
## The equivariance is an artefact of tying sigma to mu_0. It is not the physics.
## Counting error lives on the log-density scale: with SD s on ln N at each time
## point, SGR = (ln N_t - ln N_0)/t has SD ~ s*sqrt(2)/t, which does not depend
## on the growth rate. Two tests with the same counting precision and different
## control growth rates have the same absolute SGR noise and different signal.
## Holding sigma_0 fixed is therefore what lets R enter at all, and it enters
## the way it should -- as signal-to-noise, which is also what OECD TG 201's
## R >= 16 validity criterion is implicitly buying.
